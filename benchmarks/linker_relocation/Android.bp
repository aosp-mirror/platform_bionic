// TODO: This benchmark doesn't work with TradeFed/atest because it doesn't copy its test libraries
// into the testcases/linker_reloc_bench directory. The obvious way to do that is to list each
// library in the "data" property, but that doesn't work, because each library is listed as having a
// "link:shared" variant (as opposed to "link:static"), whereas the cc_benchmark has no
// "link:(shared/static)" variation. It appears that Soong needs to be fixed to make this benchmark
// work with TradeFed/atest.
