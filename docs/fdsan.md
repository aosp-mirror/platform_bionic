## fdsan

[TOC]

fdsan is a file descriptor sanitizer added to Android in API level 29.
In API level 29, fdsan warns when it finds a bug.
In API level 30, fdsan aborts when it finds a bug.

### Background
*What problem is fdsan trying to solve? Why should I care?*

fdsan (file descriptor sanitizer) detects mishandling of file descriptor ownership, which tend to manifest as *use-after-close* and *double-close*. These errors are direct analogues of the memory allocation *use-after-free* and *double-free* bugs, but tend to be much more difficult to diagnose and fix. With `malloc` and `free`, implementations have free reign to detect errors and abort on double free. File descriptors, on the other hand, are mandated by the POSIX standard to be allocated with the lowest available number being returned for new allocations. As a result, many file descriptor bugs can *never* be noticed on the thread on which the error occurred, and will manifest as "impossible" behavior on another thread.

For example, given two threads running the following code:
```cpp
void thread_one() {
    int fd = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY);
    close(fd);
    close(fd);
}

void thread_two() {
    while (true) {
        int fd = open("log", O_WRONLY | O_APPEND);
        if (write(fd, "foo", 3) != 3) {
            err(1, "write failed!");
        }
    }
}
```
the following interleaving is possible:
```cpp
thread one                                thread two
open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 123
close(123) = 0
                                          open("log", O_WRONLY | APPEND) = 123
close(123) = 0
                                          write(123, "foo", 3) = -1 (EBADF)
                                          err(1, "write failed!")
```

Assertion failures are probably the most innocuous result that can arise from these bugs: silent data corruption [[1](#footnotes), [2](#footnotes)] or security vulnerabilities are also possible (e.g. suppose thread two was saving user data to disk when a third thread came in and opened a socket to the Internet).

### Design
*What does fdsan do?*

fdsan attempts to detect and/or prevent file descriptor mismanagement by enforcing file descriptor ownership. Like how most memory allocations can have their ownership handled by types such as `std::unique_ptr`, almost all file descriptors can be associated with a unique owner which is responsible for their closure. fdsan provides functions to associate a file descriptor with an owner; if someone tries to close a file descriptor that they don't own, depending on configuration, either a warning is emitted, or the process aborts.

The way this is implemented is by providing functions to set a 64-bit closure tag on a file descriptor. The tag consists of an 8-bit type byte that identifies the type of the owner (`enum android_fdan_owner_type` in [`<android/fdsan.h>`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/main/libc/include/android/fdsan.h)), and a 56-bit value. The value should ideally be something that uniquely identifies the object (object address for native objects and `System.identityHashCode` for Java objects), but in cases where it's hard to derive an identifier for the "owner" that should close a file descriptor, even using the same value for all file descriptors in the module can be useful, since it'll catch other code that closes your file descriptors.

If a file descriptor that's been marked with a tag is closed with an incorrect tag, or without a tag, we know something has gone wrong, and can generate diagnostics or abort.

### Enabling fdsan (as a user)
*How do I use fdsan?*

fdsan has four severity levels:
 - disabled (`ANDROID_FDSAN_ERROR_LEVEL_DISABLED`)
 - warn-once (`ANDROID_FDSAN_ERROR_LEVEL_WARN_ONCE`)
   - Upon detecting an error, emit a warning to logcat, generate a tombstone, and then continue execution with fdsan disabled.
 - warn-always (`ANDROID_FDSAN_ERROR_LEVEL_WARN_ALWAYS`)
   - Same as warn-once, except without disabling after the first warning.
 - fatal (`ANDROID_FDSAN_ERROR_LEVEL_FATAL`)
   - Abort upon detecting an error.

In Android Q, fdsan has a global default of warn-once. fdsan can be made more or less strict at runtime via the `android_fdsan_set_error_level` function in [`<android/fdsan.h>`](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/main/libc/include/android/fdsan.h).

The likelihood of fdsan catching a file descriptor error is proportional to the percentage of file descriptors in your process that are tagged with an owner.

### Using fdsan to fix a bug
*No, really, how do I use fdsan?*

Let's look at a simple contrived example that uses sleeps to force a particular interleaving of thread execution.

```cpp
#include <err.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <chrono>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

#include <android-base/unique_fd.h>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;
using std::this_thread::sleep_for;

void victim() {
  sleep_for(300ms);
  int fd = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);
  sleep_for(200ms);
  ssize_t rc = write(fd, "good\n", 5);
  if (rc == -1) {
    err(1, "good failed to write?!");
  }
  close(fd);
}

void bystander() {
  sleep_for(100ms);
  int fd = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);
  sleep_for(300ms);
  close(fd);
}

void offender() {
  int fd = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);
  close(fd);
  sleep_for(200ms);
  close(fd);
}

int main() {
  std::vector<std::thread> threads;
  for (auto function : { victim, bystander, offender }) {
    threads.emplace_back(function);
  }
  for (auto& thread : threads) {
    thread.join();
  }
}
```

When running the program, the threads' executions will be interleaved as follows:

```cpp
// victim                         bystander                       offender
                                                                  int fd = dup(1); // 3
                                                                  close(3);
                                  int fd = dup(1); // 3
                                                                  close(3);
int fd = dup(1); // 3
                                  close(3);
write(3, "good\n") = ðŸ˜ž;
```

which results in the following output:

    fdsan_test: good failed to write?!: Bad file descriptor

This implies that either we're accidentally closing out file descriptor too early, or someone else is helpfully closing it for us. Let's use `android::base::unique_fd` in `victim` to guard the file descriptor with fdsan:

```diff
--- a/fdsan_test.cpp
+++ b/fdsan_test.cpp

   if (rc == -1) {
     err(1, "good failed to write?!");
   }

 }

 void bystander() {
```

Now that we've guarded the file descriptor with fdsan, we should be able to find where the double close is:

...in the obviously correct bystander? What's going on here?

The reason for this is (hopefully!) not a bug in fdsan, and will commonly be seen when tracking down double-closes in processes that have sparse fdsan coverage. What actually happened is that the culprit closed `bystander`'s file descriptor between its open and close, which resulted in `bystander` being blamed for closing `victim`'s fd. If we store `bystander`'s fd in a `unique_fd` as well, we should get something more useful:
```diff

Hooray!

In a real application, things are probably not going to be as detectable or reproducible as our toy example, which is a good reason to try to maximize the usage of fdsan-enabled types like `unique_fd` and `ParcelFileDescriptor`, to improve the odds that double closes in other code get detected.

### Enabling fdsan (as a C++ library implementer)

fdsan operates via two main primitives. `android_fdsan_exchange_owner_tag` modifies a file descriptor's close tag, and `android_fdsan_close_with_tag` closes a file descriptor with its tag. In the `<android/fdsan.h>` header, these are marked with `__attribute__((weak))`, so instead of passing down the platform version from JNI, availability of the functions can be queried directly. An example implementation of unique_fd follows:

### Frequently seen bugs
 * Native APIs not making it clear when they take ownership of a file descriptor. <br/>
   * Solution: accept `unique_fd` instead of `int` in functions that take ownership.
   * [Example one](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/core/+/721985), [two](https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/native/+/709451)
 * Receiving a `ParcelFileDescriptor` via Intent, and then passing it into JNI code that ends up calling close on it. <br/>
   * Solution: Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯. Use fdsan?
