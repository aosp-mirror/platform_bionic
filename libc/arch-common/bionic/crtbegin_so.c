/* CRT_LEGACY_WORKAROUND should only be defined when building
 * this file as part of the platform's C library.
 *
 * The C library already defines a function named 'atexit()'
 * for backwards compatibility with older NDK-generated binaries.
 *
 * For newer ones, 'atexit' is actually embedded in the C
 * runtime objects that are linked into the final ELF
 * binary (shared library or executable), and will call
 * __cxa_atexit() in order to un-register any atexit()
 * handler when a library is unloaded.
 *
 * This function must be global *and* hidden. Only the
 * code inside the same ELF binary should be able to access it.
