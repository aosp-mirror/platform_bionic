# This file is used to populate seccomp's whitelist policy in combination with SYSCALLS.TXT.
# Note that the resultant policy is applied only to zygote spawned processes.
#
# The final seccomp whitelist is SYSCALLS.TXT - SECCOMP_BLACKLIST.TXT + SECCOMP_WHITELIST.TXT
# Any entry in the blacklist must be in the syscalls file and not be in the whitelist file
#
# Each non-blank, non-comment line has the following format:
#
# return_type func_name[|alias_list][:syscall_name[:socketcall_id]]([parameter_list]) arch_list
#
# where:
#       arch_list ::= "all" | arch+
#       arch      ::= "arm" | "arm64" | "mips" | "mips64" | "x86" | "x86_64"
#
# Note:
#      - syscall_name corresponds to the name of the syscall, which may differ from
#        the exported function name (example: the exit syscall is implemented by the _exit()
#        function, which is not the same as the standard C exit() function which calls it)

#      - alias_list is optional comma separated list of function aliases
#
#      - The call_id parameter, given that func_name and syscall_name have
#        been provided, allows the user to specify dispatch style syscalls.
#        For example, socket() syscall on i386 actually becomes:
#          socketcall(__NR_socket, 1, *(rest of args on stack)).
#
#      - Each parameter type is assumed to be stored in 32 bits.
#
# This file is processed by a python script named genseccomp.py.

# Note: Some privileged syscalls are still needed in app process after fork before uid change,
# including capset and setresuid. This is because the seccomp filter must be installed while
# the process still has CAP_SYS_ADMIN; changing the uid would remove that capability.
