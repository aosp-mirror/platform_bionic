# This file is used to populate seccomp's allowlist policy in combination with SYSCALLS.TXT.
# Note that the resultant policy is applied only to zygote spawned processes.
#
# The final seccomp allowlist is SYSCALLS.TXT - SECCOMP_BLOCKLIST.TXT + SECCOMP_ALLOWLIST.TXT
# Any entry in the blocklist must be in the syscalls file and not be in the allowlist file
