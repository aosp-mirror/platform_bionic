 *
 * Note that Android (like most Unix systems) allows "overcommit". This
 * allows processes to allocate more memory than the system has, provided
 * they don't use it all. This works because only "dirty" pages that have
 * been written to actually require physical memory. In practice, this
 * means that it's rare to see memory allocation functions return a null
 * pointer, and that a non-null pointer does not mean that you actually
 * have all of the memory you asked for.
 *
 * Note also that the Linux Out Of Memory (OOM) killer behaves differently
 * for code run via `adb shell`. The assumption is that if you ran
 * something via `adb shell` you're a developer who actually wants the
 * device to do what you're asking it to do _even if_ that means killing
 * other processes. Obviously this is not the case for apps, which will
 * be killed in preference to killing other processes.
