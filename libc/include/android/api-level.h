#ifndef __ANDROID_API__
/**
 * `__ANDROID_API__` is the [API
 * level](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
 * this code is being built for. The resulting binaries are only guaranteed to
 * be compatible with devices which have an API level greater than or equal to
 * `__ANDROID_API__`.
 *
 * For NDK and APEX builds, this macro will always be defined. It is set
 * automatically by Clang using the version suffix that is a part of the target
 * name. For example, `__ANDROID_API__` will be 24 when Clang is given the
 * argument `-target aarch64-linux-android24`.
 *
 * For non-APEX OS code, this defaults to  __ANDROID_API_FUTURE__.
 *
 * The value of `__ANDROID_API__` can be compared to the named constants in
 * `<android/api-level.h>`.
 *
 * The interpretation of `__ANDROID_API__` is similar to the AndroidManifest.xml
 * `minSdkVersion`. In most cases `__ANDROID_API__` will be identical to
 * `minSdkVersion`, but as it is a build time constant it is possible for
 * library code to use a different value than the app it will be included in.
 * When libraries and applications build for different API levels, the
 * `minSdkVersion` of the application must be at least as high as the highest
 * API level used by any of its libraries which are loaded unconditionally.
 *
 * Note that in some cases the resulting binaries may load successfully on
 * devices with an older API level. That behavior should not be relied upon,
 * even if you are careful to avoid using new APIs, as the toolchain may make
 * use of new features by default. For example, additional FORTIFY features may
 * implicitly make use of new APIs, SysV hashes may be omitted in favor of GNU
 * hashes to improve library load times, or relocation packing may be enabled to
 * reduce binary size.
 *
 * See android_get_device_api_level(),
 * android_get_application_target_sdk_version() and
 * https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/main/docs/defines.md.
