/**
 * Register a new buffer to get logged into tombstones for crashes.
 *
 * It will be added to both the tombstone proto in the crash_detail field, and
 * in the tombstone text format.
 *
 * Tombstone proto definition:
 *   https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:system/core/debuggerd/proto/tombstone.proto
 *
 * An app can get hold of these for any `REASON_CRASH_NATIVE` instance of
 * `android.app.ApplicationExitInfo`.
 *
 * https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo#getTraceInputStream()

 * The lifetime of name and data has to be valid until the program crashes, or until
 * android_crash_detail_unregister is called.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   const char* stageName = "garbage_collection";
 *   crash_detail_t* cd = android_crash_detail_register("stage", stageName, strlen(stageName));
 *   do_garbage_collection();
 *   android_crash_detail_unregister(cd);
 *
 * If this example crashes in do_garbage_collection, a line will show up in the textual representation of the tombstone:
 *   Extra crash detail: stage: 'garbage_collection'
 *
 * Introduced in API 35.
 *
 * \param name identifying name for this extra data.
 *             this should generally be a human-readable debug string, but we are treating
 *             it as arbitrary bytes because it could be corrupted by the crash.
 * \param name_size number of bytes of the buffer pointed to by name
 * \param data a buffer containing the extra detail bytes, if null the crash detail
 *             is disabled until android_crash_detail_replace_data replaces it with
 *             a non-null pointer.
 * \param data_size number of bytes of the buffer pointed to by data
 *
 * \return a handle to the extra crash detail.
