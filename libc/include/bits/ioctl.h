 * will break existing code that takes the address of ioctl. If such a breakage
 * occurs, you can work around it by either:
 * - specifying a concrete, correct type for ioctl (whether it be through a cast
 *   in `(int (*)(int, int, ...))ioctl`, creating a temporary variable with the
 *   type of the ioctl you prefer, ...), or
 * - defining BIONIC_IOCTL_NO_SIGNEDNESS_OVERLOAD, which will make the
