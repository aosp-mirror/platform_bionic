 * The program startup function __libc_init() defined here is
 * used for static executables only (i.e. those that don't depend
 * on shared libraries). It is called from arch-$ARCH/bionic/crtbegin_static.S
 * which is directly invoked by the kernel when the program is launched.
 *
 * The 'structors' parameter contains pointers to various initializer
 * arrays that must be run before the program's 'main' routine is launched.
