// be visible from libc later on.
//
// Note: this function creates a pthread_internal_t for the initial thread and
// stores the pointer in TLS, but does not add it to pthread's thread list. This
// has to be done later from libc itself (see __libc_init_common).
//
// This is in a file by itself because it needs to be built with
// -fno-stack-protector because it's responsible for setting up the main
// thread's TLS (which stack protector relies on). It's also built with
// -ffreestanding because the early init function runs in the linker before
// ifunc resolvers have run.

// Do enough setup to:
//  - Let the dynamic linker invoke system calls (and access errno)
//  - Ensure that TLS access functions (__get_{tls,thread}) never return NULL
//  - Allow the stack protector to work (with a zero cookie)
// Avoid doing much more because, when this code is called within the dynamic
// linker, the linker binary hasn't been relocated yet, so certain kinds of code
// are hazardous, such as accessing non-hidden global variables or calling
// string.h functions.
